<td>
Searched and worked on IBM Bluemix Stream analytics, OpenWhisk and Cloud Object Storage services. What I found was, there is posibility to store an object or file in cloud object storage and retrieve it by GET method using IBM stream analytics.The coding language is SPL(Stream Processing Language). For our scenario and design we can easily use stream analytics to stream data and store it in object storage; no need for OpenWhisk service. Unlike AWS which we can only stream the data through Kenisis and by a Lambda Node.js function we could store data to S3. There is an IDE for Stream analytics; IBM Stream Stedio.

<td>21.01.17 - 27.01.17</td>
<td>Worked on how to combine the Cloud Object Storage to OpenWhisk Service. I found that AWS RTSP reference architecture requires to store data stream in S3 because if the Lambda couldn't process are the data stream then it can retrieve data stream from S3. Using IBM Bluemix platform for RTSP reference architecture we need no Cloud Object Storage to Downstream. </td>
